By default, all libraries are assumed to be in the directory defined by XRAY_15X_LIBS environment variable.

To build X-Ray Engine you'll need following libraries and SDKs:
  * nVidia OpenAutomate [https://developer.nvidia.com/openautomate]
  * libjpeg [http://sourceforge.net/projects/libjpeg]
    - Use "jpeg" as project root directory name for compatibility with CxImage
  * zlib [http://zlib.net]
  * BugTrap [https://github.com/nitrocaster/BugTrap]
  * Windows SDK [http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8279]
  * DirectX SDK June 2010 [http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812]
    - replace dxguid.lib with the one from Windows SDK
      (for DirectPlay GUIDs)

Mixed configuration isn't currently configured properly,
Debug/Release should work.
